Notes for future versioned changelog

=====================================
Date: 2026-01-23
Component: WinProgramManager

FEATURE: Professional Startup Loading Dialog
--------------------------------------------
- Implemented threaded loading dialog with continuous animated spinner
- Loading dialog runs in independent thread with own message loop
- Spinner animation never freezes during database loading operations
- White background design matching Windows design language
- Blue spinner (RGB 0, 120, 215) for visual consistency
- Internationalization support for loading text

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Loading dialog created in separate thread using LoadingDialogThread()
- Independent message loop prevents UI freezing during main window operations
- Timer-based spinner animation (60ms intervals) with Unicode characters (◐ ◓ ◑ ◒)
- WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC handler for white backgrounds and blue text coloring
- Background thread handles database opening and data loading
- Main window brought to foreground after loading completes (SetForegroundWindow)

INTERNATIONALIZATION:
- Added "processing_database" field to Locale structure
- Updated locale files:
  * en_GB.txt: "Processing database..."
  * nb_NO.txt: "Behandler database..."
  * sv_SE.txt: "Bearbetar databas..."
- Loading text dynamically loaded from locale files

USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Continuous spinner animation from start to finish
- No UI freezing during expensive operations (control creation, database loading)
- Professional appearance with clean white backgrounds
- Immediate visual feedback that application is loading
- Main window automatically activated and brought to front when ready
