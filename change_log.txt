=== WinProgramSuite Change Log ===
Notes for future versioned changelog

=====================================
Date: 2026-02-01 (Update 6 - Winget List Parser Fix for Variable Column Count)
Component: WinProgramManager / WinProgramUpdater

CRITICAL PARSER FIX: Variable Column Count Support
---------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed SyncInstalledApps() to handle variable column count in "winget list" output
- Bug: Parser used fixed positional logic (tokens[size-3] = ID), failed when "Available" column present
- Impact: ~5 packages missing including Notepad++.Notepad++, possibly Total Commander, Blender
- Root Cause: When updates available, winget list shows 5 columns instead of 4:
  * Without updates: Name | Id | Version | Source (4 columns)
  * With updates: Name | Id | Version | Available | Source (5 columns)
  * Fixed position parsing captured "Available" value instead of package ID
- Fix: Implemented regex-based right-to-left package ID detection:
  * Pattern: ^[A-Za-z0-9+_-]*[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9+._-]*\.[A-Za-z0-9+_-]*[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9+._-]*$
  * Requires letters on both sides of dot to distinguish from version numbers (e.g., 8.9.1)
  * Supports + character for packages like Notepad++.Notepad++
  * Scans tokens right-to-left starting after Source column
  * Falls back to positional logic if no regex match found
- Additional Fixes:
  * Spinner animation filtering: Winget uses \r for progress spinner, now filters lines with only -, \, |, / chars
  * Carriage return handling: Changed ExecuteWingetCommand from getline() to istreambuf_iterator
  * Character support: Added + to allowed package ID characters (was only ._-)
- Result: All packages correctly detected, verified Notepad++, Total Commander, Blender in database (49 packages total)
- Debug logging: Added comprehensive trace to sync_debug.txt in LOCALAPPDATA for troubleshooting

=====================================
Date: 2026-02-01 (Update 5 - Critical Bug Fixes & Performance Optimization)
Component: WinProgramManager / WinProgramUpdater

CRITICAL BUGFIX: Database Deletion Prevention
---------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed CRITICAL database wipe bug in WinProgramUpdater.cpp
- Bug: DeleteFileW(L"WinProgramsSearch.db") used relative path instead of absolute path
- Impact: Could delete main database (10,780+ apps) if working directory was incorrect
- Fix: Changed to DeleteFileW(searchDbPath_.c_str()) using absolute path calculated in constructor
- Prevention: All file operations now use searchDbPath_ member variable with full path
- Recovery: Database backup system proved invaluable, restored 116MB database from .\DB\ backup
- Result: Database file operations are now safe regardless of working directory

MAJOR BUGFIX: Winget Batch Mode Parsing
---------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed GetPackageInfo() parsing failure in WinProgramUpdater.cpp
- Bug: Parser stopped at first spinner line (764-935 chars), never found "Found" line in batch mode
- Impact: All 35 packages cross-referenced from installed_apps failed with "Could not retrieve package info"
- Root Cause: Batch mode output differs from interactive mode:
  * Interactive: Has "Found <Name> [PackageId]" line
  * Batch: No "Found" line, starts directly with "Version:" field
  * Both: Can have 764-935 character spinner progress lines
- Fix: Implemented foundName flag that continues searching for "Found" line through entire output
- Fallback: If no "Found" line found, extract name from packageId (e.g., "7zip.7zip" → "7zip")
- Result: Parser now handles both interactive and batch modes, all 35 packages added successfully

PERFORMANCE: Step 2.5 Eliminated (4+ hours → <1 second)
---------------------------------------------------------
- Replaced PowerShell loop calling winget show 259 times with single SQL query
- Old: External add_missing_installed_packages.ps1 script took 4+ hours
- New: SQL cross-reference query using ATTACH DATABASE completed instantly:
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT sr.package_id 
  FROM search_db.search_results sr 
  INNER JOIN installed_apps ia ON sr.package_id = ia.package_id 
  WHERE sr.package_id NOT IN (SELECT package_id FROM apps);
  ```
- Consolidated Step 8 into Step 2 (8 steps → 7 steps)
- Step 2 now handles both initial packages and cross-referenced installed packages
- Summary positioned correctly to include counts from both addition loops

UI IMPROVEMENTS: Verbose Logging & Clean Output
---------------------------------------------------------
- Implemented callback infrastructure for WinProgramUpdaterGUI:
  * SetLogCallback() with userData pointer
  * SetStatsCallback() for progress updates
  * SetCancelFlag() for interruption support
- All 7 steps now have verbose logging with BEGIN/END markers
- Step 2 output cleaned: Removed extra blank lines before summary
- Fixed "installed" word appearing in 4 message locations (redundant with context)
- Log() function converts \n to \r\n for Windows Edit controls
- Added 300ms delay between GetPackageInfo() calls to reduce winget stress

DATABASE ARCHITECTURE: Path Safety
---------------------------------------------------------
- searchDbPath_ member variable calculated in constructor from main dbPath_
- ATTACH DATABASE now uses escaped searchDbPath_ instead of hardcoded 'WinProgramsSearch.db'
- All database operations use absolute paths from member variables
- Working directory independence ensures reliability across execution contexts

LESSONS LEARNED:
---------------------------------------------------------
- NEVER use relative paths with DeleteFileW() - always use absolute paths
- Winget output format differs between interactive and batch modes
- Parser must handle both spinner lines AND missing "Found" lines
- Database backups are ESSENTIAL - saved entire project from data loss
- SQL queries vastly outperform repeated command execution (4+ hours → instant)
- User intuition matters: "if delay was issue, first would succeed" led to parsing discovery

RESULTS:
- Database: Safe from accidental deletion (10,780 apps preserved)
- Parsing: All 35 missing packages successfully added
- Performance: Step 2.5 eliminated, 4+ hours saved
- Update process: 8 steps consolidated to 7 steps
- Output: Clean, verbose logging without formatting issues

=====================================
Date: 2026-01-26 (Update 4 - Complete Installed Apps Integration)
Component: WinProgramManager / WinProgramUpdater

FEATURE: All Installed Apps Now in Database
---------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed missing installed packages issue: All 47 installed apps now appear in database and UI
- Implemented Step 2.5: Automatic addition of missing installed packages
- Safe deletion logic protects installed apps from being removed
- Hybrid PowerShell architecture resolves C++ pipe buffering issues

STEP 2.5 - MISSING PACKAGE HANDLER:
- New updater step runs after installed apps sync
- Queries database for packages in installed_apps but not in main apps table
- Calls PowerShell script (add_missing_installed_packages.ps1) to fetch metadata
- Uses winget show for each missing package to get complete information
- Inserts package details into apps table with tags
- Handles all packages that weren't captured by winget search

HYBRID POWERSHELL ARCHITECTURE:
Problem Solved: C++ CreateProcess with pipes would hang indefinitely on winget show output
- winget sends progress indicators (spinner chars) that fill pipe buffer
- ReadFile() blocks waiting for more data, CreateProcess deadlocks
- Multiple attempted fixes: PeekNamedPipe, temp files, all failed

Solution: External PowerShell scripts called from C++
- add_missing_installed_packages.ps1: Adds missing packages with full metadata
- check_deleted_packages.ps1: Safely removes obsolete packages
- Scripts packaged with sqlite3.exe for database operations
- C++ orchestrates via CreateProcessA without pipe redirection
- Reliable winget interaction without buffering issues

SAFE PACKAGE DELETION (Step 3):
Logic: Delete ONLY if package is NOT in winget catalog AND NOT installed
- Runs comprehensive "winget search ." to get entire catalog (~10,811 packages)
- Compares database against full catalog, not just search results
- Protects installed apps even if delisted from winget
- Safely removes truly obsolete packages (not available + not installed)
- Result: Database reduced from 10,811 to 10,693 (118 obsolete removed)

ZERO MAGIC NUMBERS:
- All operations driven by database queries and winget API
- No hardcoded package lists or manual interventions
- Systematic approach ensures consistency and maintainability

SCRIPTS:
- WinProgramManager/scripts/add_missing_installed_packages.ps1
  * Query missing packages via SQL
  * Run winget show for each package
  * Parse output for name, version, publisher, tags
  * Insert into apps and app_tags tables
  * Verbose logging with counts and status

- WinProgramManager/scripts/check_deleted_packages.ps1
  * Run winget search . for complete catalog
  * Parse all available package IDs
  * Query non-installed packages from database
  * Delete packages not in catalog AND not installed
  * Comprehensive safety check with 10-minute timeout

PACKAGING:
- makeit.bat updated to package scripts/ folder
- sqlite3.exe copied to WinProgramManager/sqlite3/ for script use
- Scripts work independently of C++ execution context

RESULTS:
- Database: 10,693 apps, 47 installed_apps
- All 47 installed apps present in main apps table
- "Installed" filter shows complete list
- No missing packages, no false deletions

=====================================
Date: 2026-01-26 (Update 3 - Installed Apps Sync Fixed)
Component: WinProgramManager / WinProgramUpdater

BUGFIX: Winget List Parsing Now Working
---------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed SyncInstalledApps() function in WinProgramUpdater.cpp
- Winget list output successfully parsed: 47-52 installed apps detected
- Changed parsing strategy from left-to-right column positions to right-to-left tokenization

PARSING STRATEGY (Right-to-Left):
- Split line into tokens by whitespace
- Rightmost token: Source (e.g., "winget") - must have NO digits
- Second from right: Version number
- Third from right: Package ID
- Remaining tokens: Application name
- Handles lines with and without Source column

VALIDATION LOGIC:
- Reject lines where rightmost token contains any digit (malformed entries)
- Require package ID to contain at least one dot or backslash
- Skip header, separator, and empty lines
- Filter out version-only IDs

REGIONAL COMPATIBILITY:
- Handles Greek regional settings with 60+ second winget response times
- Added --disable-interactivity flag to winget commands
- INFINITE wait in WaitForSingleObject handles regional latency
- No timeout issues despite slow winget responses

DATABASE RESULTS:
- Successfully populates installed_apps table on update
- 47 valid entries from 52 parsed packages (validation filters some)
- Installed filter now shows user's actual installed applications
- Real-time tracking of installation status

STEP 8 OUTPUT:
Before: "Found 0 installed packages"
After: "Found 52 installed packages" → 47 valid entries in database

=====================================
Date: 2026-01-25 (Update 2 - Installed Apps Filter)
Component: WinProgramManager

FEATURE: Installed Apps Filter with Database Integration
---------------------------------------------------------
- Implemented "Installed" button to filter apps by installation status
- Integrated with installed_apps database table for persistent tracking
- Visual state indication: Green with checkmark when active, blue when inactive
- Animated loading dialog when deactivating filter (same as End Search)
- Button color matches Search button design (RGB 10,57,129)

INSTALLED APPS TRACKING:
- installed_apps table with package_id, installed_date, source columns
- sync_installed_apps.ps1 script for database synchronization
- Tracks winget-installed packages on user's system
- Shows count of installed apps in categories and main list

FILTER BEHAVIOR:
- Toggle button: Click once to activate, click again to deactivate
- When active: Shows only installed apps (44 apps in current system)
- When active: Categories filtered to show only those with installed apps (190 categories)
- When deactivated: Shows loading spinner while repopulating full list
- Preserves all search and filter capabilities

USER INTERFACE:
- Button states:
  * Inactive: Blue (RGB 10,57,129), text "Installed"
  * Active: Green (RGB 40,140,40), text "✓ Installed" with checkmark
  * Hover effects for both states
- Positioned next to Search button for consistent navigation
- Smooth spinner animation when returning to all apps

MODULAR ARCHITECTURE:
- installed_apps.h: Public API with 7 functions
- installed_apps.cpp: Encapsulated implementation with static module state
- Clean separation from main.cpp
- O(1) lookup performance using std::set<std::wstring>

DATABASE CLEANUP:
- Removed 169 invalid version-number-only entries (e.g., "0.0.3", "1.0.0")
- Enhanced build_winget_db.ps1 with validation:
  * Rejects package IDs containing only digits, dots, and plus signs
  * Requires at least one letter in package ID
  * Prevents future parse errors
- Final database: 10,981 valid apps (down from 11,150)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Database relationship: apps.package_id → installed_apps.package_id
- LoadInstalledPackageIds() populates in-memory cache from database
- IsPackageInstalled() performs O(1) set lookup
- IsInstalledFilterActive() / SetInstalledFilterActive() manage filter state
- LoadTags() and LoadApps() respect installed filter when active
- Spinner dialog matches End Search behavior for consistency
