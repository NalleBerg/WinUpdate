about_modes_intro=The program can run in three modes:
about_mode1_title=Manual
about_mode1_desc=You open the program, and winget (built into Windows 10 and 11), which the program uses, looks up which updates there are for the programs you have installed on your machine. You choose which ones you want to install, or click "Select all" to install everything. Then you click "Update now" and the programs you have selected will be updated to the latest version.
about_mode2_title=Scan at Windows startup
about_mode2_desc=Every time you start Windows, it performs a scan in the background, and opens the program if any updates are found. Otherwise, the program also works as manual mode.
about_mode3_title=Run in the system tray
about_mode3_desc=The program starts at startup and scans for updates, before it places itself in the system tray (bottom right, by the clock), where it scans for updates after the time interval you have selected in "Settings". When it finds updates, it will notify you through Windows' notification system. You can then click on the icon in the system tray to open the program and view/install the update(s).
about_no_ms_account=You do not need to be logged into your Microsoft account to use the program.
about_conclusion=From now on you can be more up to date on your PC than you ever have been before!
about_license_info=License: GPLv2 — view license by clicking the button at the bottom left
about_description=WinUpdate is an application that ensures you stay up to date. It supports over 11,000 packages applications from numerous developers.

about_description2=The program can run in three modes:

1: Manual
You open the program, and winget (built into Windows 10 and 11), which the program uses, searches for available updates to the programs installed on your machine. You choose which ones to install, or click "Select all" to install everything. Then you click "Upgrade now" and your selected programs are updated to the latest version.

2: Scan at Windows startup
Every time you start Windows, it performs a background scan and opens the program if any updates are found. Otherwise, the program works the same as in manual mode.

3: Run in the system tray
The program starts at boot and scans for updates, then places itself in the system tray (bottom right, by the clock), where it scans for updates at intervals you choose in "Settings". When it finds updates, it notifies you through Windows' notification system. You can then click the icon in the system tray to open the program and view/install the update(s).

You don't need to be logged into your Microsoft account to use the program.

From now on, you can be more up to date on your PC than you've ever been before!
